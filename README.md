# Garden Project

A garden project written in p5.js for college course prepwork.

## How to run

### Linux

**REQURIES `tmux`**

Simply clone the project and then run the start.sh script. The project can then
be seen at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Other

To run on another OS you will need to find some way to host a local http server,
and then serve the `index.html` file. Simply opening the `index.html` will **not** work.
