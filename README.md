# Garden Project

A garden project written in p5.js for college course prepwork.

## How to run

### Linux

**REQURIES `tmux` (from distro package manager) and `http-server` (from npm)**

Simply clone the project and then run the start.sh script. The project can then
be seen at `http://localhost:8080`. 

### p5 Web Editor

The project can also be found on the [p5 web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/21507/sketches/Sgp9pBQ1j).

### Other

To run on another OS you will need to find some way to host a local http server,
and then serve the `index.html` file. Simply opening the `index.html` will **not** work.
